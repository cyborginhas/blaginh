I am a PhD Student in Geospatial Analytics at NC State conducting research with the [Landscape Dynamics Group](https://geospatial.ncsu.edu/landscapedynamics/people/ross-meentemeyer/). My current research focuses on using big data, geospatial methods, and deep learning to improve the data-driven, near-real-time [Pest or Pathogen Spread (PoPS) Model](https://popsmodel.org/). The PoPS model can forecast the spread of highly destructive invasive pests and pathogens, and is used by federal and state managers to find optimal strategies to offset the substantial economic and ecological damages caused by continued invasive species spread.
