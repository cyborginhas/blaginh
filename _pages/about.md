I am a PhD Student in Geospatial Analytics at NC State conducting research with the [Landscape Dynamics Group](https://geospatial.ncsu.edu/landscapedynamics/people/ross-meentemeyer/). My current research focuses on using big data, geospatial methods, and deep learning to improve the data-driven, near-real-time [Pest or Pathogen Spread (PoPS) Model](https://popsmodel.org/). The PoPS model is used to forecast the spread of invasive pest and pathogens that threaten food security, ecosystems, and economies. These forecasts can be used as a decision support tool by managers to determine how to optimally allocate resources to minimize damages from invasive species.
