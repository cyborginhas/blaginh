I am a PhD Student in Geospatial Analytics at NC State conducting research with the [Landscape Dynamics Group](https://geospatial.ncsu.edu/landscapedynamics/people/ross-meentemeyer/). My research interests lie in using big data, geospatial methods, and deep learning methods to find innovative solutions to stopping the spread of invasive species - a grand environmental challenge threatening food security, economies, and ecosystems around the globe. 

At NC State, my PhD research contributes to the [Pest or Pathogen Spread (PoPS) Model](https://popsmodel.org/) developed by the [Landscape Dynamics Group](https://geospatial.ncsu.edu/landscapedynamics/people/ross-meentemeyer/). PoPS is a data-driven, stochastic spatiotemporal model capable of producing near-real-time forecasts of invasive species. My research focuses on quantifying and reducing the uncertainty in the drivers of invasive spread forecasting (i.e. the main factors dictating where and/or how quickly an invader spreads in area), which will improve the PoPS forecast's reliability in detecting optimal strategies to minimize damages from further invasive species spread.
