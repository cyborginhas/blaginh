I am a PhD Student in Geospatial Analytics at NC State conducting research with the [Landscape Dynamics Group](https://geospatial.ncsu.edu/landscapedynamics/people/ross-meentemeyer/). My current research focuses on using big data, geospatial methods, and deep learning to improve the data-driven, near-real-time [Pest or Pathogen Spread Model](https://popsmodel.org/).
